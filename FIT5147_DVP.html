            <p>This is a visualization narrative created to explain the performance of team Natus Vincere in the CS:GO Major championship held at Stockholm in early November 2021.</p>
            <p>Before the performance is analysed through the use of visuals, first a walkthrough of CS:GO must be done.</p>

            <p><h1>CS:GO and Major</h1></p>
            <p>CS:GO (Counter Strike : Global Offensive) is a first person online multiplayer game that allows players to engage in a 5v5 battle for various tournaments. Among those is a tournament called the "Major".
                It is the most pretigious tournament with the highest prize pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the game can be traditionally classified as a victory through elimination due to the shooter nature of it, when playing at the highest professional level, it is way more complex than it appears
                <br>
                The game can be either won through - 
                <ul>
                    <li>Elimination of enemy team</li>
                    <li>Planting/defusing bomb depending on the side</li>
                </ul>
                The game can be won by winning 16/30 rounds in regulation (or by winning 4/6 when overtime rules are applied) over 7 selected maps that are selected by the game
                developers before the tournament.
                <br>
                Majors are events that consist of 16 teams of which 4 make the playoffs with 1 eventual champion. Currently there are 2 majors every <b>year</b>.

            <p><h1>Data Visualization Project</h1></p>
            <p>
                The most recent even was won by the team Natus Vincere undefeated in every map/series they played. This project is a way to analyse the performance of the champions in comparison to other 
                teams at the event.
